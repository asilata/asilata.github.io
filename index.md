### Interests
I am a PhD student in [Mathematics](http://math.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/), advised by Victor Ginzburg.
I was an undergraduate at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu).

I am interested in representation theory, singularity theory, and algebraic geometry.
My CV may be found [here](assets/bapat-cv.pdf).
