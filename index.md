### Research interests and background

My research focuses on problems in representation theory and algebraic geometry. 
I am most interested in the topology and geometry of algebraic varieties arising from representation theory.
Recently I have also been working with group actions on triangulated categories, and connections to Bridgeland stability conditions.
Particular topics of interest include Bridgeland stability conditions, perverse sheaves, quiver varieties, equivariant cohomology, and Bernstein--Sato polynomials.
My papers and preprints are on my [research page](/research), and my CV is available [here](assets/bapat-cv.pdf).

### Teaching
In 2020 semester 2, I am teaching Games, Graphs, and Machines ([MATH2301](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/MATH2301)).
Some course notes are available at the [public course webpage](https://asilata.github.io/ggm).

Older teaching is listed on my [teaching page](teaching/).

### Current and upcoming activities

{% capture currenttime %}{{ site.time }}{% endcapture %}
{% assign activities = site.data.activities | where_exp: "activity", "activity.date > currenttime" | sort: 'date' %}
<ul>
{% for activity in activities %}
<li>
{% unless activity.current == true %}
<strong>{% if activity.display-date %}{{ activity.display-date | markdownify | strip | remove: '<p>' | remove: '</p>' }}{% else %}{{ activity.date | date: "%b %Y" }}{% endif %}:</strong>
{% endunless %}
{{ activity.content | markdownify | strip | remove: '<p>' | remove: '</p>'}}{% if activity.location %}, {{ activity.location | remove: '<p>' | remove: '</p>'}}{% endif %}
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

I am in the process of rewriting the MSI LaTeX templates for exams using [org-babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/). It is very much a work in progress, but you can view the source code (at your own risk) in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/asilata/msi-exam-template/).

Older activities are listed on my [activities page](activities/).
