### Research interests and background

My research focuses on problems in representation theory and algebraic geometry. 
Broadly, I am interested in the topology and geometry of algebraic varieties arising from representation theory.
Specific topics of interest include perverse sheaves, equivariant cohomology, and Bernstein--Sato polynomials.
My papers and preprints can be found on my [research page](/research).

I completed my PhD at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/) under the supervision of Victor Ginzburg.
I was an undergraduate at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu).

My CV is available [here](assets/bapat-cv.pdf).

### Teaching
In Fall 2016, I am teaching Math 2250 (Calculus I for Science and Engineering).
Older teaching activities are listed on my [teaching page](teaching/).

### Other activities

* Together with [Paul Sobaje](http://www.math.uga.edu/directory/paul-sobaje), I am organizing the UGA Algebra Seminar. Our calendar is [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?mode=AGENDA&src=ss4ps8h03v62f1vhuf40c2j87o@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York). Please contact either one of us if you would like to give a talk!
